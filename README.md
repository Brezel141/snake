#Snake Game:

This is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Snake game, developed using the Pygame library in Python.

##Description:

In this game, the player controls a snake, guiding it across the screen to consume food items. Each item consumed makes the snake grow longer, increasing the challenge. The primary objective is to gather as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the game area's walls or the snake's own growing body. The gameplay is straightforward but becomes progressively challenging as the snake grows.
